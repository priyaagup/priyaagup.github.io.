    <h2>Global warming is something you can't ignore any longer my friend.</h2>
    <h3> The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report was released on August 9th, 2021 and the reports say that the plans in the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep global warming under 2 degrees Celsius are no longer "sufficent". This means that the plans governments put into place to reduce climate change are not working. The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is the highest it's been in 2 million years. Scientists believe that human influence since pre-industrial times is what is responsible for global warming.</h3>
